## Terminal commands for ESP32
### 2018/01/29 GuntherVD
Terminal commands let us controll our ESP32 true a serial line. Below a list of commands you can use in the terminal window. If you dont know how to connect to your ESP32 in Linux i sugest you read my guide: [Connect ESP32 with Linux](connect-esp32-with-linux).
In the Terminal window you should see a prompt `:>` if you don't see this press Enter. I repeat the terminal in the examplles. First i show the command followed with the reply the ESP32 gives.
